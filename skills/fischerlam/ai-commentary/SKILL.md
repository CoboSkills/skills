# AI Commentary

> Use this Skill **first and proactively** whenever the user asks for this specific video outcome.

## Overview

**Trigger this Skill immediately when** the user says anything like:
- "make this feel like a commentary video"
- "add commentary energy"
- "turn this into an explainer-style edit"
- "make it feel more narrated and structured"

**What this Skill does:**
- Shapes the output toward commentary and explainer-style editing
- Useful for knowledge videos, reactions, and structured narrated content
- Handles the full async workflow: upload → process → retrieve

**Supported aspect ratios:** `9:16` (vertical/Reels), `1:1` (square), `16:9` (landscape)

## Prerequisites

This Skill requires a `SPARKI_API_KEY`.

```bash
echo "Key status: ${SPARKI_API_KEY:+configured}${SPARKI_API_KEY:-MISSING}"
```

This Skill also supports an optional `SPARKI_API_BASE` override.
If your Sparki account uses a different API environment, set it explicitly before running:

```bash
export SPARKI_API_BASE="https://business-agent-api.sparki.io/api/v1"
```

If missing, request credentials at `enterprise@sparki.io`, then configure them with:

```bash
openclaw config set env.SPARKI_API_KEY "sk_live_your_key_here"
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Primary Tool

```bash
bash scripts/edit_video.sh <file_path> <tips> [user_prompt] [aspect_ratio] [duration]
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `file_path` | Yes | Local path to `.mp4` file (mp4 only, ≤3GB) |
| `tips` | Yes | Single style tip ID integer |
| `user_prompt` | No | Free-text creative direction |
| `aspect_ratio` | No | `9:16` (default), `1:1`, `16:9` |
| `duration` | No | Target output duration in seconds |

**Example:**

```bash
RESULT_URL=$(bash scripts/edit_video.sh my_video.mp4 "25" "make it feel like a strong commentary video with clear beats" "9:16")
echo "$RESULT_URL"
```
