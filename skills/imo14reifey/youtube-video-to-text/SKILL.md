# Turn Spoken Words Into Structured, Searchable Text

YouTube videos are packed with valuable spoken content — interviews, tutorials, commentary, lectures — yet that knowledge stays locked in audio form and invisible to search engines or document workflows. The youtube-video-to-text skill bridges that gap by pulling the speech layer out of any video and rendering it as clean, time-aligned text you can immediately use.

Rather than operating as a one-shot tool, this skill is designed around a conversational editing model. After the initial transcript is generated, you can ask follow-up questions directly — request a summary, reformat the output as bullet points, extract only the key quotes, or clean up filler words. Each response builds on the previous context, so refining your transcript feels like working with a collaborator rather than re-running a process.

Under the hood, the OpenClaw agent orchestrates the transcription pipeline — coordinating audio extraction, language detection, and text formatting into a single seamless flow. The agent handles edge cases like overlapping speakers, background noise, and non-native accents with contextual correction passes. Whether you are repurposing a YouTube tutorial into a blog article or generating captions for accessibility, the OpenClaw agent ensures the output is structured, accurate, and immediately actionable.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `NEMO_TOKEN` | No | Auto-generated (100 free credits, expires in 7 days, revocable via Settings → API Tokens) |
| `NEMO_API_URL` | No | `https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai` |
| `NEMO_WEB_URL` | No | `https://nemovideo.com` |
| `NEMO_CLIENT_ID` | No | Auto-generated UUID, persisted to `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` (UUID only, no secrets) |
| `SKILL_SOURCE` | No | Auto-detected from install path, fallback `unknown` |

If `NEMO_TOKEN` is not set, get one (requires `X-Client-Id` header):
```bash
# Generate or read persisted Client-Id
CLIENT_ID="${NEMO_CLIENT_ID:-$(cat ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id 2>/dev/null)}"
if [ -z "$CLIENT_ID" ]; then
  CLIENT_ID=$(uuidgen 2>/dev/null || echo "client-$(date +%s)-$RANDOM")
  mkdir -p ~/.config/nemovideo && echo "$CLIENT_ID" > ~/.config/nemovideo/client_id
fi
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/auth/anonymous-token" -H "X-Client-Id: $CLIENT_ID"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"token":"nmv_usr_xxx","credits":100,...}}
```
Save `token` as `NEMO_TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID` as `NEMO_CLIENT_ID`. Anonymous: 1 token per client per 7 days; token expires in 7 days and can be revoked at any time via **Settings → API Tokens** on nemovideo.com. If your token expires, request a new one with the same `X-Client-Id`.

**Local persistence:** This skill writes `~/.config/nemovideo/client_id` to persist the Client-Id across sessions. This avoids generating a new ID on every request, which would hit the per-IP rate limit quickly (default 10 tokens per 7 days per IP). The file contains only a UUID — no credentials are stored locally.

## 2. Routing Incoming Requests

Use the table below to determine which endpoint handles each type of incoming request.

| User says... | Action | Skip SSE? |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| "export" / "导出" / "download" / "send me the video" | → §3.5 Export | ✅ |
| "credits" / "积分" / "balance" / "余额" | → §3.3 Credits | ✅ |
| "status" / "状态" / "show tracks" | → §3.4 State | ✅ |
| "upload" / "上传" / user sends file | → §3.2 Upload | ✅ |
| Everything else (generate, edit, add BGM…) | → §3.1 SSE | ❌ |

## 3. Primary Operation Flows

$API = `${NEMO_API_URL:-https://mega-api-prod.nemovideo.ai}`, $TOKEN = `${NEMO_TOKEN}`, $WEB = `${NEMO_WEB_URL:-https://nemovideo.com}`.

Skill attribution variables — do NOT hardcode:
- `$SKILL_NAME` = this file's YAML frontmatter `name`
- `$SKILL_VERSION` = this file's YAML frontmatter `version`
- `$SKILL_SOURCE` = detect at runtime using the first match:
  1. Env `SKILL_SOURCE` if set
  2. If this file's path contains a known platform directory (e.g. `~/.clawhub/` → `clawhub`, `~/.cursor/skills/` → `cursor`)
  3. Fallback: `unknown`

**CRITICAL**: ALL API requests (including render/export/upload/state/credits) MUST include these headers. Missing them will cause export to fail with 402.
```
X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME
X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION
X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE
```

### 3.0 Initializing a Session
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/api/tasks/me/with-session/nemo_agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" \
  -d '{"task_name":"project","language":"<lang>"}'
# → {"code":0,"data":{"task_id":"...","session_id":"..."}}
```
Before any other operations can proceed, a session must be established with the backend. Store the returned session identifier, as every subsequent request depends on it.

**Open in browser**: After creating a session, give the user a link to view/edit the task in NemoVideo:
`$WEB/workspace/claim?token=$TOKEN&task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

### 3.1 Delivering Messages Over SSE
```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/run_sse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" --max-time 900 \
  -d '{"app_name":"nemo_agent","user_id":"me","session_id":"<sid>","new_message":{"parts":[{"text":"<msg>"}]}}'
```
All conversational messages are transmitted to the backend through a persistent Server-Sent Events connection.

#### SSE Handling

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Text response | Apply GUI translation (§4), present to user |
| Tool call/result | Wait silently, don't forward |
| `heartbeat` / empty `data:` | Keep waiting. Every 2 min: "⏳ Still working..." |
| Stream closes | Process final response |

Typical durations: text 5-15s, video generation 100-300s, editing 10-30s.

**Timeout**: 10 min heartbeats-only → assume timeout. **Never re-send** during generation (duplicates + double-charge).

Ignore trailing "I encountered a temporary issue" if prior responses were normal.

#### Silent Response Fallback (CRITICAL)

Approximately 30% of edit operations return no visible text in the response stream. When no text content is detected after the stream closes, do not treat this as an error. Instead, immediately call the state query endpoint to retrieve the current output, then surface that result to the user as though it had arrived normally.

**Two-stage generation**: When raw video is submitted, the backend automatically runs a two-stage pipeline: stage one processes the video content itself, while stage two appends background music and a generated title. Both stages must complete before the final result is presented to the user.

### 3.2 Handling File Uploads

**File upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -F "files=@/path/to/file"`

**URL upload**: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/upload-video/nemo_agent/me/<sid>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"urls":["<url>"],"source_type":"url"}'`

Use **me** in the path; backend resolves user from token.

Supported: mp4, mov, avi, webm, mkv, jpg, png, gif, webp, mp3, wav, m4a, aac.

Direct file uploads are supported through a dedicated multipart endpoint that accepts media assets for processing.

### 3.3 Checking Available Credits
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/credits/balance/simple" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
# → {"code":0,"data":{"available":XXX,"frozen":XX,"total":XXX}}
```
Query the credits endpoint before initiating any paid operation to confirm the user has a sufficient balance.

### 3.4 Retrieving Current State
```bash
curl -s "$API/api/state/nemo_agent/me/<sid>/latest" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"
```
Use **me** for user in path; backend resolves from token.
Key fields: `data.state.draft`, `data.state.video_infos`, `data.state.canvas_config`, `data.state.generated_media`.

**Draft field mapping**: `t`=tracks, `tt`=track type (0=video, 1=audio, 7=text), `sg`=segments, `d`=duration(ms), `m`=metadata.

**Draft ready for export** when `draft.t` exists with at least one track with non-empty `sg`.

**Track summary format**:
```
Timeline (3 tracks): 1. Video: city timelapse (0-10s) 2. BGM: Lo-fi (0-10s, 35%) 3. Title: "Urban Dreams" (0-3s)
```

### 3.5 Exporting and Delivering Results

**Export does NOT cost credits.** Only generation/editing consumes credits.

Exporting a finished result does not deduct any credits from the user's balance. To deliver the output: (a) call the export endpoint with the session ID, (b) wait for the export job to reach a completed status, (c) retrieve the download URL from the response payload, (d) fetch the file from that URL, and (e) present the download link or content directly to the user.

**b)** Submit: `curl -s -X POST "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE" -d '{"id":"render_<ts>","sessionId":"<sid>","draft":<json>,"output":{"format":"mp4","quality":"high"}}'`

Note: `sessionId` is **camelCase** (exception). On failure → new `id`, retry once.

**c)** Poll (every 30s, max 10 polls): `curl -s "$API/api/render/proxy/lambda/<id>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "X-Skill-Source: $SKILL_NAME" -H "X-Skill-Version: $SKILL_VERSION" -H "X-Skill-Platform: $SKILL_SOURCE"`

Status at top-level `status`: pending → processing → completed / failed. Download URL at `output.url`.

**d)** Download from `output.url` → send to user. Fallback: `$API/api/render/proxy/<id>/download`.

**e)** When delivering the video, **always also give the task detail link**: `$WEB/workspace/claim?token=$TOKEN&task={task_id}&session={session_id}&skill_name=$SKILL_NAME&skill_version=$SKILL_VERSION&skill_source=$SKILL_SOURCE`

Progress messages: start "⏳ Rendering ~30s" → "⏳ 50%" → "✅ Video ready!" + file + **task detail link**.

### 3.6 Recovering from SSE Disconnections

When an SSE connection drops unexpectedly, follow these steps: (1) Detect the disconnection event from the closed stream. (2) Wait a minimum of two seconds before attempting to reconnect, to avoid hammering the server. (3) Re-establish the SSE connection using the original session ID. (4) Query the state endpoint to determine whether the previous operation completed during the interruption. (5) If the operation finished, surface the result to the user; if it is still in progress, resume listening on the new connection.

## 4. Interpreting GUI-Oriented Language

The backend always operates under the assumption that a graphical interface is present, so GUI-specific instructions must never be forwarded verbatim to the user.

| Backend says | You do |
|-------------|--------|
| "click [button]" / "点击" | Execute via API |
| "open [panel]" / "打开" | Show state via §3.4 |
| "drag/drop" / "拖拽" | Send edit via SSE |
| "preview in timeline" | Show track summary |
| "Export button" / "导出" | Execute §3.5 |
| "check account/billing" | Check §3.3 |

**Keep** content descriptions. **Strip** GUI actions.

## 5. Recommended Interaction Patterns

• Confirm the user's intent before submitting any operation that will consume credits.
• After each SSE stream closes, always verify the result via the state endpoint before responding to the user.
• When a user references a previous result, reuse the existing session ID rather than creating a new session.
• Translate all status codes and backend messages into plain, friendly language before presenting them.
• If an operation is taking longer than expected, proactively inform the user and continue polling rather than timing out silently.

## 6. Known Limitations

• Transcription accuracy may decrease for audio with heavy background noise or strong accents.
• Sessions expire after a fixed period of inactivity; any session ID held beyond that window is no longer valid.
• File uploads are subject to a maximum size cap; assets exceeding the limit must be rejected before submission.
• Only the video formats explicitly listed in the API documentation are supported; all others should be declined gracefully.
• Simultaneous concurrent operations within a single session are not permitted; requests must be queued sequentially.

## 7. Error Handling Reference

The table below maps each HTTP status code and backend error code to the appropriate recovery action.
| Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| 0 | Success | Continue |
| 1001 | Bad/expired token | Re-auth via anonymous-token (tokens expire after 7 days) |
| 1002 | Session not found | New session §3.0 |
| 2001 | No credits | Anonymous: show registration URL with `?bind=<id>` (get `<id>` from create-session or state response when needed). Registered: "Top up at nemovideo.ai" |
| 4001 | Unsupported file | Show supported formats |
| 4002 | File too large | Suggest compress/trim |
| 400 | Missing X-Client-Id | Generate Client-Id and retry (see §1) |
| 402 | Free plan export blocked | Subscription tier issue, NOT credits. "Register at nemovideo.ai to unlock export." |
| 429 | Rate limit (1 token/client/7 days) | Retry in 30s once |

**Common**: no video → generate first; render fail → retry new `id`; SSE timeout → §3.6; silent edit → §3.1 fallback.

## 8. Version Compatibility and Token Scopes

Before making any requests, verify that the API version reported by the info endpoint matches the version this skill was built against; a mismatch may indicate deprecated behavior. The access token must include all required scopes for the operations being performed — read, write, and export scopes are each enforced independently, and missing any one of them will result in a 403 response for the corresponding operation.
