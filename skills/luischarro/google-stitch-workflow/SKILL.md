# Google Stitch Workflow

Use Google Stitch primarily as a design exploration and screen-iteration system.
For greenfield apps, once a screen direction is accepted and exportable code is available in the active environment, use the generated HTML/CSS as the translation base rather than recreating the design from screenshots by hand.

This skill separates three concerns that are often conflated:

- verified MCP capabilities in the current environment
- browser-only Stitch product features
- optional local workflow conventions that improve traceability

## Quick operating rules

If you only remember a few things, remember these:

- inspect the project and target screen before editing
- work one screen at a time
- keep prompts short, explicit, and preservation-oriented
- review the visual result before the next major step
- move to code only after one direction is clearly accepted

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the task involves one or more of these goals:

- inspect Stitch projects and screens before making changes
- generate a new screen from a text prompt
- refine an existing generated screen with small, controlled edits
- organize a multi-screen redesign effort without losing revision history
- convert vague design requests into structured prompts

Do not assume the browser UI, the public product marketing, and the MCP surface expose the same operations.

## When not to use this skill

Do not use Stitch as the primary path when the real task is:

- implementing production UI code directly
- making deterministic pixel-perfect edits to an existing coded screen
- redesigning an app without reliable reference screens or screenshots
- planning an entire product in one step without screen-level iteration
- evaluating engineering feasibility without a prior visual direction

Important nuance:

- for an existing coded app, Stitch is usually best as a design reference and iteration surface
- for a new app with no established implementation, accepted Stitch exports can be the fastest way to seed the first real UI structure

## Design principles

- prefer verified MCP behavior over product-level assumptions
- use Stitch for exploration and iteration, not implementation
- for greenfield work, treat accepted exported code as a translation seed, not as untouchable production code
- keep prompts narrow, explicit, and preservation-oriented
- treat local workflow enhancements as optional conventions

## Read only what you need

- Prompt reference: [`references/prompt-structuring.md`](./references/prompt-structuring.md)
- Visual review and artifacts reference: [`references/visual-review-and-artifacts.md`](./references/visual-review-and-artifacts.md)
- Redesign prompt patterns: [`references/redesign-prompt-patterns.md`](./references/redesign-prompt-patterns.md)
- Local workflow conventions: [`references/local-workflow-conventions.md`](./references/local-workflow-conventions.md)
- Keep the main skill focused on operating rules. Use the prompt reference only when the request needs prompt shaping or prompt repair.

## Operating model

Stitch is most reliable when treated as an iterative design system:

1. inspect the current project and target screen
2. generate or edit one screen at a time
3. review the visual output immediately
4. preserve what must stay stable
5. move to code only after the screen direction is coherent

Preferred discipline:

- review screenshots or returned visual artifacts immediately after each generate or edit
- keep one screen as the unit of iteration
- do not ask the user to reason from opaque screen IDs alone when visual confirmation is available

Avoid using Stitch as if it were a deterministic code generator or a full-product planner in a single prompt.

## What a good Stitch pass should produce

A successful pass should leave the session with:

- one clearly identified target project
- one clearly identified canonical screen or small set of candidate screens
- the exact prompt or edit intent that produced the result
- a short judgment on whether the result is accepted, rejected, or needs another small iteration

If those artifacts are missing, slow down and re-establish state before continuing.

## Capability boundaries

### Verified MCP capabilities

These tools have been validated in live use and are the default safe surface:

- `list_projects`
- `get_project`
- `list_screens`
- `get_screen`
- `create_project`
- `generate_screen_from_text`
- `edit_screens`

### Known weak or unverified areas

Treat these as unstable until revalidated in the active environment:

- `generate_variants`
- screenshot-driven redesign through MCP
- prototype creation through MCP
- browser-style canvas operations beyond basic project and screen inspection

### Browser-only product features

The Stitch web product may expose richer flows such as:

- image or screenshot redesign
- prototype-oriented workflows
- broader canvas interactions
- newer browser-facing product features

Do not infer that MCP can perform those actions directly.

## Parameter discipline

The MCP surface is parameter-sensitive. Incorrect casing or identifier shape can produce generic invalid-argument failures.

### `deviceType`

Use uppercase enum values when explicitly setting a device:

- `"MOBILE"`
- `"DESKTOP"`

If uncertain, omit the parameter instead of guessing.

### `modelId`

Use only verified model identifiers for direct MCP calls in the current environment.

Known working values from live testing:

- `"GEMINI_3_FLASH"`
- `"GEMINI_3_PRO"`

If a local wrapper maps model names differently, treat that as wrapper-specific behavior, not as a direct MCP guarantee.

### `selectedScreenIds`

For `edit_screens`, pass bare screen IDs rather than full resource names.

Example:

```json
{
  "projectId": "15190935684505273965",
  "selectedScreenIds": ["69b3228b6c5f4b9f9efceea4b6a30168"],
  "deviceType": "MOBILE",
  "prompt": "Make the primary button darker and add a small secondary text link below it."
}
```

## Recommended workflows

### Workflow A: inspect before editing

Before any edit:

- inspect the project
- inspect the target screen
- verify whether the screen is actually generated content

Practical heuristic:

- if `htmlCode` exists, the screen is more likely to be safely editable
- if the target is only an uploaded image or reference asset, do not assume `edit_screens` will behave well

### Workflow B: generate first, then refine

For new directions:

1. create or choose the right project
2. generate a first screen with the minimum safe parameter set
3. review output quality
4. move to small edits rather than repeating large generation prompts

Default safe starting point:

- `projectId`
- a short, structured prompt

Then add:

- `deviceType: "MOBILE"` or `"DESKTOP"` if needed
- `modelId` only when there is a reason to choose one

Recommended model usage:

- use `"GEMINI_3_FLASH"` for faster exploratory passes
- use `"GEMINI_3_PRO"` when the direction is already clear and quality matters more than latency

### Workflow B2: greenfield app bootstrap from Stitch exports

Use this when the product is new enough that there is no meaningful coded UI to preserve yet.

1. generate the canonical screen family in Stitch first
2. get explicit acceptance on the direction before broad implementation
3. if code or HTML export is available in the active environment, download it
4. read the export completely before rewriting anything
5. translate the exported structure into the target stack instead of eyeballing screenshots
6. keep the layout system, spacing logic, token choices, and section structure where they are sound
7. replace hardcoded content and brittle markup gradually, not all at once
8. add the real app concerns after translation: data flow, typing, state, accessibility, dark mode, tests

Use this path especially when:

- the app is being built from scratch
- Stitch generated a strong screen family quickly
- the main value is the concrete composition, hierarchy, and token choices
- recreating the same layout manually would be slower and less faithful

Do not treat the export as production-ready final code. Treat it as a high-fidelity implementation seed.

### Workflow C: full-app redesign

For an existing product redesign:

1. create a dedicated Stitch project
2. define the main screen families
3. generate one canonical screen per family
4. refine those canonical screens with preservation-first prompts
5. only then add alternate states and edge cases
6. move to code after the family set is coherent

This is slower than opportunistic one-off generation, but it reduces design drift.

### Workflow D: reference-driven redesign

When redesigning a real app:

- gather reliable reference captures first
- work one screen family at a time
- name the relevant reference images explicitly in the prompt
- treat those references as the source of truth for current structure

Good pattern:

```text
Use the uploaded real app references in this project.
The relevant images are named today_top.png, today_day_actions.png, and today_meals_mid.png.
Those images show what exists now.
Keep the real structure and improve only hierarchy, spacing, and polish.
Do not invent new sections.
```

### Workflow E: visual review before further iteration

Use this when the session already has multiple candidate screens or when the
next edit would otherwise be ambiguous.

1. use `list_screens` to find the likely targets
2. use `get_screen` to inspect candidate screens
3. when a screenshot or visual artifact is available, review it before the next major edit
4. ask the user to choose using a human description of the screen, not only an opaque ID
5. continue only after the canonical target is clear

### Workflow F: decide whether to stay in Stitch or move to code

Stay in Stitch when:

- the information architecture is still drifting
- the visual hierarchy is still weak
- multiple screen directions are still being explored
- the user is reacting to screenshots rather than implementation details

Move to code when:

- one canonical screen direction is accepted
- the required elements are stable
- the remaining work is implementation fidelity rather than design exploration
- the screen can be implemented coherently in the target stack

For greenfield work, prefer this move-to-code order:

1. generate mobile and desktop canonical screens separately when both matter
2. accept the visual direction
3. export or download the generated code artifact when available
4. translate that artifact into the real stack
5. only then start screen-by-screen product hardening

## Optional local workflow enhancements

If you want aliases, execution artifacts, derivation history, or last-active-screen state, use [`references/local-workflow-conventions.md`](./references/local-workflow-conventions.md).

These are useful for traceability, but they are optional and not part of the Stitch MCP contract.

## Session discipline

- inspect before editing
- review the returned screen before issuing another large prompt
- prefer one short generation followed by controlled edits
- stop repeating the same failing payload
- confirm the visually reviewed canonical screen before moving to export or code translation
- move to code only after the screen family is coherent

## Failure handling

### `Request contains an invalid argument.`

Check in this order:

1. `deviceType` casing
2. `modelId` spelling
3. `selectedScreenIds` shape
4. whether the screen is genuinely editable generated output
5. whether the prompt is trying to change too much at once

Long-running operations may still complete even when the client appears to
fail. Re-check `list_screens`, inspect any likely new screens, and avoid blind
re-submission of the same prompt.

Do not brute-force retries with the same payload.

### Generation or edit timeout

Long-running operations may time out even when Stitch completes them asynchronously.

Safe reconciliation pattern:

1. do not immediately resend the same request
2. re-check `list_screens`
3. inspect whether a new screen appeared
4. retry only if no result landed

### Incomplete or lagging screen lists

`list_screens` may lag behind a successful operation.

If the originating call indicated success, re-check before retrying. Do not assume immediate list lag means failure.

## Review gate before code translation

Do not port a Stitch output into code until these conditions are true:

- required elements are still present
- the primary user task is clearer than before
- mobile density and hierarchy are acceptable
- the screen fits the rest of the project direction
- the design can be implemented coherently in the current application architecture

If the answer is not clearly yes, keep iterating in Stitch.

For greenfield translation from exported Stitch code, also check:

- the exported code represents the accepted direction, not an older candidate
- the layout system is coherent enough to preserve rather than rewrite immediately
- the token layer can be mapped into the target project's theme system
- there is a plan to replace placeholders and hardcoded demo content with real data
- the team will translate deliberately instead of pasting large exports blindly

## Naming guidance for larger projects

If the project will contain many screens, use stable ordered titles from the start.

Recommended pattern:

- `01 Onboarding - Welcome`
- `02 Onboarding - Personal Info`
- `10 Today - Main`
- `20 Progress - Overview`
- `30 History - Browse`
- `40 Settings - Profile`

This improves canvas scanning and reduces later cleanup.

## Practical defaults

- start with the smallest prompt that can produce a useful screen
- prefer one short generation followed by tiny edits
- preserve explicitly during redesign work
- inspect before editing
- treat wrapper enhancements as optional, not as part of the Stitch contract

## Not recommended

- copying browser-product claims into MCP instructions without revalidation
- treating `generate_variants` as fully dependable unless the current environment has confirmed it
- using design boards or mood boards as substitutes for real app screens in a product redesign
- attempting to redesign a whole app from memory in a single prompt
- moving into implementation code before the design family is coherent
- rebuilding an accepted greenfield Stitch design from screenshots when a usable export already exists
