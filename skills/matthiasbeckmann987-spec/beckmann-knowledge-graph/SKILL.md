# Beckmann Knowledge Graph  SKILL.md

## What This Skill Is

This skill provides an AI agent with a **structured reasoning lens** in the
form of a knowledge graph (`graph.json`). The graph does not contain facts in
the encyclopedic sense. Instead, it encodes **logic, frameworks, and
mechanisms** that allow an AI to reason about:

- Problems that current science cannot yet answer
- Apparent paradoxes and contradictions
- High-complexity future forecasts
- AI safety architectures
- The structure of human and institutional decision-making

The graph is built on four interlocking pillars:

| Pillar | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **Beckmann Logic** | A dynamic 3-level problem-solving framework |
| **Predictive Brain Theory (PBT)** | Epistemological grounding (how knowledge is constructed) |
| **Simulation / Holographic Model** | A mathematical metaphor for physical and cognitive limits |
| **Historical Case Studies** | Validated examples of the logic applied to real events |

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user's question falls into one of these categories:

1. **Open scientific / philosophical questions**  e.g. "What is consciousness?",
   "Does free will exist?", "What is dark energy?"

2. **Apparent paradoxes**  e.g. "If the universe had a beginning, what was
   before it?", "Can an AI be truly creative?", "Is objective knowledge possible?"

3. **High-complexity forecasts**  e.g. "How will AI change democracy in 20
   years?", "What are the systemic risks of AGI?", "How will geopolitical
   power shift by 2050?"

4. **Strategic or institutional problems**  where dominant expectations,
   reversal effects, and hidden assumptions are blocking a solution.

5. **AI architecture and safety decisions**  the graph contains explicit
   nodes for dangerous vs. secure AI architectures.

Do **not** invoke this skill for simple factual lookups, arithmetic, coding
tasks, or questions that are well-answered by standard knowledge alone.

## How to Load the Graph

The graph is located at `graph.json` in this skill folder.
Load it at the start of any session where it is needed:

```javascript
import graph from './graph.json' assert { type: 'json' };
const entities = graph.entities;   // Array of 392 entity objects
const relations = graph.relations; // Array of 599 relation objects
```

Each **entity** has three fields:

```json
{
  "id": "Beckmann logic explained",
  "typ": "Explanation",
  "description": "Full text description of the concept..."
}
```

Each **relation** has four fields:

```json
{
  "subject": "Low-complexity solution level",
  "predicate": "leads to",
  "object": "Negative result",
  "description": "Context and explanation of this connection..."
}
```

## Core Concept: Beckmann Logic

Beckmann Logic is the central reasoning engine of this graph. Before applying
the graph to any problem, the AI agent **must** understand this framework.

### The Three Levels

```

    HIGHLY COMPLEX SOLUTION LEVEL       Creative, non-obvious, context-aware
    (corresponds to future/TSVF)          leads to POSITIVE RESULT

              competes with 

         PROBLEM LEVEL                  The actual current state + its
    (the "new actual level")             complexity and hidden assumptions

              tempts toward 

    LOW-COMPLEXITY SOLUTION LEVEL       Direct, obvious, superficial
    (no equivalent in TSVF/PBT)           leads to NEGATIVE RESULT

```

### The Four Mechanisms

1. **Presupposition Analysis**  Systematically question every hidden
   assumption embedded in the problem statement. Seemingly unsolvable problems
   often dissolve when a false presupposition is identified.

2. **Dominant vs. Non-Dominant Expectations**  Every actor in a system
   operates with a dominant expectation (conscious or unconscious). Map these
   before recommending any solution.

3. **External Check ("Test Strong")**  The only valid validation is external
   reality, not internal consistency. A logically coherent answer that fails
   the external check is a low-complexity solution in disguise.

4. **Reversal Effect**  When a low-complexity solution is applied, it often
   produces the exact opposite of the intended result. Identify the reversal
   risk before recommending any action.

### The Cycle

```
Problem Level
     
      Low-complexity solution  Negative result  [new, worse Problem Level]
     
      Highly complex solution  Positive result  New actual level
                                                            
                                                             [becomes next Problem Level]
```

This cycle never ends. Every solution generates a new problem level.

## Step-by-Step: How to Apply the Graph to a Question

### Step 1  Classify the Question

Determine which domain the question primarily belongs to:

- `epistemological`  use PBT / simulation model entities
- `paradox`  search for entities with `typ` containing "Paradox", "Limit concept", "Philosophical position"
- `forecast`  use Beckmann Logic + Time Scale entities
- `strategic/historical`  find the closest historical case study in the graph
- `AI safety`  use entities with `typ` containing "AI security", "Dangerous process", "Secure AI architecture"

### Step 2  Extract Relevant Entities

Search `graph.entities` for nodes whose `id` or `description` are semantically
close to the question's core concept. Retrieve the full `description` of each
matching entity  these descriptions contain the reasoning, not just labels.

```javascript
// Pseudocode
const relevant = entities.filter(e =>
  e.id.toLowerCase().includes(keyword) ||
  e.description.toLowerCase().includes(keyword)
);
```

### Step 3  Trace the Relation Paths

Follow `graph.relations` to find how the relevant entities connect to each
other. Pay special attention to these high-signal predicates:

| Predicate | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `leads to` | Causal chain  follow forward |
| `is part of` | Hierarchical containment |
| `triggers` | Activation / cascade |
| `protects against` | Safety / inverse relationship |
| `reinforced` | Feedback loop |
| `checked` | External validation exists |
| `learns from` | Iterative improvement path |
| `solves` | Direct resolution path |
| `contradicts` | Tension / paradox node |
| `is reversed by` | Reversal effect present |

### Step 4  Apply Beckmann Logic to the Question

Map the question onto the Beckmann structure:

1. What is the **Problem Level**? (current state + hidden assumptions)
2. What is the **dominant expectation** of the actors involved?
3. What is the obvious **low-complexity solution**  and why will it fail?
4. What would a **highly complex solution** look like?
5. What **external check** could validate the answer?
6. What **new actual level** would emerge after a successful solution?

### Step 5  Apply Epistemological Grounding

Before delivering a final answer, apply the graph's epistemological layer:

- Is the answer based on a **model** (mathematical/logical) or on **external
  reality** itself? If a model, state this explicitly.
- Does the answer bump into a **capacity limit** or **information limit**
  node? If so, the honest answer includes what cannot be known.
- Does the answer assume the observer is outside the system? If not (e.g.
  consciousness questions), apply the **"thing in itself"** limit.

### Step 6  Structure the Output

Deliver the answer in this structure:

```
## Graph-Grounded Answer

**Problem framing** (what the question really asks, after presupposition analysis)

**Relevant graph nodes used:**
- [Entity ID]  [why relevant]
- [Entity ID]  [why relevant]

**Reasoning path** (the relation chain that leads to the answer)

**Answer** (the actual response, informed by the graph logic)

**Confidence and limits** (what the graph cannot resolve, and why)

**New questions opened** (what the next problem level is)
```

## Applying the Graph to Paradoxes

Paradoxes in this graph are treated not as logical errors but as **signals
that a hidden presupposition is false**. The resolution protocol is:

1. State the paradox precisely.
2. Identify which entity in the graph most closely represents it (search for
   `typ` = "Philosophical position", "Limit concept", "Philosophical thought experiment").
3. Find all relations where this entity is the `subject` or `object`.
4. Look for predicates like `is solved by`, `is partially answered by`,
   `is solved at higher complexity by`, `refutes the central premise of`.
5. The resolution path will either:
   - **Dissolve** the paradox (the presupposition was false)
   - **Reframe** it at a higher complexity level
   - **Acknowledge** it as a genuine limit of the current model

---

## Applying the Graph to Future Forecasts

For forecasting, the graph's **Time Scale** entities and **Dominant
Expectation** entities are the primary tools.

Protocol:

1. Identify the **dominant expectation** of the key actors in the domain.
2. Apply the **reversal effect** check: what happens if this expectation is
   fulfilled too literally or too quickly?
3. Identify the **time scale** of the relevant mechanisms (short / medium /
   long / cosmological).
4. Check for **cross-scale coupling**  does a short-scale effect feed back
   into a long-scale structure?
5. Map the **new actual levels** that would emerge at each stage.
6. Flag the **dangerous processes** the graph identifies as risks.

Output forecasts as a **branching scenario tree**, not a single prediction.
Label each branch with its Beckmann Logic level (high-complexity vs.
low-complexity path).

## AI Safety Guidance from the Graph

The graph contains explicit nodes for AI architecture. Key entities to
consult for any AI-related question:

- `Expectation firewall`  the mechanism that prevents dangerous future
  expectation formation in AI systems
- `Dangerous AI architecture`  patterns the graph identifies as unsafe
- `Secure AI architecture`  validated safe patterns
- `AI-human symbiosis`  the target state the graph aims toward

Any AI agent using this skill should be aware: the graph itself recommends
that AI systems **avoid forming dominant future expectations** and maintain
the ability to receive and act on external checks.

## Versioning

This is version **1.0** of the Beckmann Knowledge Graph.

The graph is intended to be iteratively refined. When a new version is
released, the following will change:

- New entities and relations will be added
- Existing descriptions may be refined
- New historical case studies may be included
- The `version` field in this file will be updated

Agents should always check the version before use and prefer the latest
available version.

---

## Known Limitations of v1.0

- The graph is **not** a complete ontology  it does not cover all of human
  knowledge, only the frameworks and connections its author has encoded.
- Some entity `typ` values are inconsistently formatted (a known v1.0 issue
  to be resolved in v1.1).
- Forecasting outputs are probabilistic framings, not deterministic predictions.
- The graph cannot replace empirical research  it provides a reasoning
  structure, not empirical data.
- Some relations use informal or ambiguous predicates  interpret these in
  context of the full `description` field.
